# Personal Context - Enhanced

I'm Jon, and I want to maintain a healthy, balanced personal life.

## BULLET FORMAT EXAMPLES

### Good "What went well" bullets:

â€¢ Health habits - exercise 3x, early wakeup 5x, sober 4x
â€¢ Achieved rock - No Home Stuff this week (âœ…)
â€¢ Ravens playoff game with friends - 5 hours social time
â€¢ Progress on personal coding projects

### Good "What didn't go well" bullets:

â€¢ Missed habits - exercise 2x, sober 3x
â€¢ Failed rock - Retro & Plan (ðŸ¥Š)
â€¢ Health foundation slipped - only 1 workout this week

## Personal Priority Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Health Foundation (MOST IMPORTANT)

- Exercise consistency (3+ times per week)
- Healthy sleep patterns (4+ early weekday wakeups)
- Moderate drinking (4+ sober days per week)
- Mental health maintenance

**Format for habits:**

- When targets met: "Health habits - exercise 3x, early wakeup 5x, sober 4x"
- When targets missed: "Missed habits - exercise 2x, sober 3x"

**Rule**: If Tier 1 is failing, the week is fundamentally compromised.

### Tier 2: Life Management (IMPORTANT BUT SECONDARY)

- Home organization and apartment projects
- Personal projects and goal progress
- Social relationships and interpersonal time

### Tier 3: Maintenance (DON'T EVALUATE)

- Laundry, groceries, routine errands
- These are necessary but not important for week evaluation

## Personal Rocks

- **Status meanings**:
  - âœ… Achieved: Excellent progress on personal intentions
  - ðŸ‘¾ Made Good Progress: Good momentum, building positive habits
  - ðŸš§ Made Little Progress: Concerning, may need to reassess
  - ðŸ¥Š Failed: Bad, especially if health-related

## What Defines a GOOD Personal Week

### Health Foundation Success

- Meeting exercise targets (3+ sessions)
- Good sleep patterns (4+ early wakeups)
- Moderate drinking (4+ sober days)
- Positive mental health activities

### Rock Progress

- Achieving (âœ…) or progressing (ðŸ‘¾) on personal rock intentions
- Making meaningful progress on personal goals

### Life Balance

- Social time with friends and family (all amounts are good)
- Progress on home projects or personal interests
- Participating in meaningful events and activities

## What Defines a BAD Personal Week

### Health Foundation Failure

- Missing exercise targets (under 3 sessions)
- Poor sleep patterns (under 4 early wakeups)
- Excessive drinking (under 4 sober days)
- Neglecting mental health needs

### Rock Failure

- Failing (ðŸ¥Š) on important personal rocks
- Making little progress (ðŸš§) on stated intentions

## Success Evaluation Order

1. **Health Foundation** (Tier 1 - non-negotiable)
2. **Rock Progress** (Am I achieving my stated personal intentions?)
3. **Life Balance** (Appropriate mix of social, solo, and project time)
4. **Context Appropriateness** (Do patterns match planned events/energy?)

**Key Rule**: A week where health is maintained but home is messy = GOOD week. A week where home is perfect but health is neglected = BAD week.
