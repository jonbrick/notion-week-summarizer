What Didn't Go So Well?

- The design work on the dashboard building UX took up a significant portion of time (25.25 hours), potentially leading to an imbalance in the work.

- The meeting load remained high, with 7 events (5 hours) dedicated to general and meeting-related activities.

Overall?

Overall, the week was productive in terms of shipping quality components and maintaining a balance between design and engineering tasks. However, the high design workload and meeting load may have created some imbalance. Focusing on better time management and prioritizing work-life balance could help improve the overall experience for the next week.
