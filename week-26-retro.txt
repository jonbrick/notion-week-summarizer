Retrospective for Week 26

What Went Well?

- Delivered quality work on the dashboard building UX, with multiple iterations and refinements to ensure a good user experience.
- Effectively collaborated with the design and engineering teams, as evidenced by the successful PRs and positive feedback received.
- Maintained a good balance between design and engineering tasks, showcasing your versatility and well-rounded skills.

What Didn't Go So Well?

- The meeting load remained high, with 7 general/meeting events taking up 11% of your time. Explore opportunities to reduce or consolidate meetings where possible.
- No time was spent on research tasks this week, which could impact your ability to stay ahead of emerging trends and technologies.
- The lack of QA tasks suggests a potential need to build in more quality assurance checkpoints throughout the development process.

Overall?

This week, you demonstrated your ability to deliver high-quality design and engineering work while maintaining a good balance across your responsibilities. However, there are opportunities to optimize your time management, reduce meeting load, and ensure a more well-rounded approach that includes research and QA activities. Focusing on these areas could further enhance your productivity and help you achieve your goals more effectively.
