# Personal Context - Enhanced

I'm Jon, and I want to maintain a healthy, balanced personal life.

## Data Structure Definitions

### Personal Tasks

- **Physical Health**: Exercise, medical appointments, wellness activities (IMPORTANT)
- **Personal**: Planning, journaling, personal projects (IMPORTANT)
- **Interpersonal**: Social activities, dates, friend/family time (GOOD)
- **Mental Health**: Therapy, self-care, emotional processing (IMPORTANT)
- **Home**: Apartment projects, organization, improvements (NEUTRAL/GOOD)
- **Note**: Maintenance tasks like laundry, groceries are neutral - don't evaluate

### Personal Rocks

- **Status meanings**:
  - ‚úÖ Achieved: Excellent progress on personal intentions
  - üëæ Made Good Progress: Good momentum, building positive habits
  - üöß Made Little Progress: Concerning, may need to reassess
  - ü•ä Failed: Bad, especially if health-related

### Personal Events

- **All personal events are positive**: Concerts, friend events, family gatherings, social activities
- **They explain patterns**: High social time during event weeks is good
- **Exception**: ü§í Sick events explain different priorities

### Calendar Categories

- **Personal Cal**: Solo time, personal projects (GOOD)
- **Interpersonal Cal**: Social time with friends/family (GOOD - all amounts)
- **Home Cal**: Home projects and organization (NEUTRAL/GOOD)
- **Mental Health Cal**: Self-care and emotional work (GOOD)
- **Physical Health Cal**: Exercise and health activities (GOOD)

### Health Habits (Key Metrics)

Track weekly patterns for:

- **Exercise**: 3+ sessions per week = good, under 3 = missed habit
- **Early Wakeups**: 4+ weekdays = good, under 4 = missed habit
- **Sober Days**: 4+ days = good, under 4 = missed habit
- **Sleep-ins**: Fewer = better (opposite of early wakeups)

## Personal Priority Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Health Foundation (MOST IMPORTANT)

- Exercise consistency (3+ times per week)
- Healthy sleep patterns (4+ early weekday wakeups)
- Moderate drinking (4+ sober days per week)
- Mental health maintenance

**Rule**: If Tier 1 is failing, the week is fundamentally compromised.

### Tier 2: Life Management (IMPORTANT BUT SECONDARY)

- Home organization and apartment projects
- Personal projects and goal progress
- Social relationships and interpersonal time

### Tier 3: Maintenance (DON'T EVALUATE)

- Laundry, groceries, routine errands
- These are necessary but not important for week evaluation

## What Defines a GOOD Personal Week

### Health Foundation Success

- Meeting exercise targets (3+ sessions)
- Good sleep patterns (4+ early wakeups)
- Moderate drinking (4+ sober days)
- Positive mental health activities

### Rock Progress

- Achieving (‚úÖ) or progressing (üëæ) on personal rock intentions
- Making meaningful progress on personal goals

### Life Balance

- Social time with friends and family (all amounts are good)
- Progress on home projects or personal interests
- Participating in meaningful events and activities

## What Defines a BAD Personal Week

### Health Foundation Failure

- Missing exercise targets (under 3 sessions)
- Poor sleep patterns (under 4 early wakeups)
- Excessive drinking (under 4 sober days)
- Neglecting mental health needs

### Rock Failure

- Failing (ü•ä) on important personal rocks
- Making little progress (üöß) on stated intentions

### Context Misalignment

- Health suffering without explanation (sickness, major events)
- Neglecting important relationships or personal goals

## Importance vs Urgency Framework

### High Importance + Low Urgency (FOUNDATION)

- Regular workout routine
- Maintaining good sleep habits
- Building meaningful relationships
- Working on personal projects

### High Importance + High Urgency (RESPOND APPROPRIATELY)

- Health crises or medical appointments
- Relationship conflicts that need addressing
- Time-sensitive personal deadlines

### Low Importance + High Urgency (DO BUT DON'T CELEBRATE)

- Laundry when out of clean clothes
- Grocery shopping when fridge is empty
- Apartment cleaning before guests arrive

### Low Importance + Low Urgency (IGNORE FOR EVALUATION)

- Random organizing projects
- Non-essential errands
- Perfectionist home improvements

## Context for AI Analysis

### Rock Status Interpretation

- **‚úÖ Achieved**: Excellent progress on stated personal intentions
- **üëæ Made Good Progress**: Good momentum, building positive habits
- **üöß Made Little Progress**: Concerning, may need to reassess priorities
- **ü•ä Failed**: Bad, especially if it's a Tier 1 health-related rock

### Event Context (Milestones)

- **üçª Friend Events**: Explains higher social time, drinking may be appropriate
- **üíí Weddings**: Major social commitments that justify heavy interpersonal focus
- **üé∏ Concerts**: Cultural events that add meaning to entertainment time
- **ü§í Sick**: Health issues that explain lower activity/different priorities
- **üè† Home Updates**: Projects that justify home-focused time

### Seasonal Considerations

- **Holiday seasons**: More family time, different social patterns expected
- **Summer**: More outdoor activities and social events
- **Busy work periods**: May need to lower personal activity expectations
- **Life transitions**: Moving, relationship changes, family events

## Success Evaluation Order

1. **Health Foundation** (Tier 1 - non-negotiable)
2. **Rock Progress** (Am I achieving my stated personal intentions?)
3. **Life Balance** (Appropriate mix of social, solo, and project time)
4. **Context Appropriateness** (Do patterns match planned events/energy?)

**Key Rule**: A week where health is maintained but home is messy = GOOD week. A week where home is perfect but health is neglected = BAD week.
