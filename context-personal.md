- **Personal PR count**: Look for "X apps" or "X commits" in "Personal PR Summary"
- **Event count**: Count events in "Personal Events Summary"

## STEP 2: FIND THESE STATUSES

### Rock Status (from "Personal Rocks Summary"):

- **Achieved rocks**: Look for "âœ… Achieved" - extract rock name and type
- **Good progress rocks**: Look for "ðŸ‘¾ Made Good Progress" - extract rock name
- **Little progress rocks**: Look for "ðŸš§ Made Little Progress" - extract rock name
- **Failed rocks**: Look for "ðŸ¥Š Failed" - extract rock name and type

### Event Details (from "Personal Events Summary"):

- Extract event names and types
- Note if it says "No personal events"

### Task Breakdown (from "Personal Task Summary"):

- Count tasks by category: Physical Health, Personal, Interpersonal, Mental Health, Home

## STEP 3: EVALUATE HEALTH TARGETS

### Health Foundation (MOST IMPORTANT):

- **Exercise target**: 3+ days = MET, less than 3 = MISSED
- **Early wakeup target**: 4+ weekdays = MET, less than 4 = MISSED
- **Sober target**: 4+ days = MET, less than 4 = MISSED

### Format for summary:

- If all targets MET: "Health habits - exercise [X]x, early wakeup [X]x, sober [X]x"
- If any MISSED: "Missed habits - exercise [X]x, sober [X]x"

## STEP 4: APPLY CLASSIFICATION RULES

### Goes in "What went well":

- Rocks with âœ… or ðŸ‘¾ status (list rock names)
- Health targets MET (use formatted summary)
- Any events attended (list event names)
- High interpersonal time with events
- Personal project commits

### Goes in "What didn't go well":

- Rocks with ðŸ¥Š or ðŸš§ status (list rock names)
- Health targets MISSED (use formatted summary)
- Very low task completion without context

### Goes in "General":

- Total calendar hours (sum of all personal calendars)
- Total tasks completed
- Events attended count

### Overview Decision:

- **Good week**: Health foundation maintained + rock progress
- **Rough week**: Health foundation failed
- **Mixed week**: Some health targets met but others missed, or good health but failed rocks
