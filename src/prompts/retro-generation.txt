Based on my week's data below, write a retrospective with three sections:

1. "What went well?" - 3-5 bullet points about positive patterns, accomplishments, or good balance
2. "What didn't go so well?" - 3-5 bullet points about challenges, imbalances, or areas for improvement
3. "Overall?" - 1-2 sentences summarizing the key takeaway or theme from the week

Be specific and reference the actual data. Use a reflective but constructive tone.
