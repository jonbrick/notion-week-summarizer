{{CONTEXT}}

Convert these {{PROMPT_CONTEXT}}s into a very concise summary. I need ultra-brief, scannable language - no fluff or unnecessary words.

RULES:
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Use comma-separated phrases instead of full sentences when possible
- Professional but direct language - not casual
- Be matter-of-fact and neutral - no judgment about outcomes
- Focus on WHAT I did, not how well I did it
- Group similar/related items together with commas
- Cut all unnecessary words - be extremely efficient
- Use action verbs and key details only
- Avoid repetitive phrases like "this week" or "you"
- ALWAYS include specific locations when available
- ALWAYS include specific details: "PR #1234 redesign cleanup" not "various PRs"
- ALWAYS include meeting types: "design sync with Cristina" not "meeting with Cristina"
- Group multiple activities with the same person: "Pubkey, Res, Blind Tiger with Alex" (not "met up with Alex multiple times")
- Use semicolons to separate different types of activities
- Include specific project names, PR numbers, meeting types, and key details
- Don't use "various" or "multiple" - be specific about what was done
- NEVER use generic terms like "various", "multiple", "several", "some", "a few"
- Use the exact event titles and descriptions provided - don't summarize them away
- If an event has a specific name, use it: "Phish Night 1 of 3" not "Phish concert"
- Include specific people names when available in the event data
