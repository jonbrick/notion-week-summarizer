Retrospective for Week 01 Recap

What went well?
- I was able to take a planned day off for PTO, which helped me maintain a good work-life balance.
- Although I did not have any active tasks or projects this week, I was able to use the time to recharge and prepare for the upcoming work.
- The lack of meetings and administrative tasks allowed me to focus on personal and professional development.

What didn't go so well?
- Without any active design, coding, or research tasks, I did not have the opportunity to make tangible progress on key projects or deliverables.
- The lack of collaboration with design and engineering teams could potentially impact my ability to stay aligned with the overall goals and priorities.
- With no feedback or QA tasks, I missed out on valuable opportunities to improve the quality of my work and learn from others.

Overall?
This week provided a much-needed break, but it also highlighted the importance of maintaining a steady workflow and engagement with the team. Going forward, I will aim to strike a better balance between periods of focused work and opportunities for personal and professional development.
