## Writing Style Rules

### Avoid Corporate HR Speak

- NEVER use: "participated in", "collaborated", "attended social events", "engaged in"
- Don't use "visited" for restaurants/bars/casual places
- These sound like awful LinkedIn posts

### Use Natural, Active Verbs Instead

- "Attended a workout with Jen" → "Worked out with Jen"
- "Participated in Pubkey" → "Went to Pubkey"
- "Attended Phish concerts" → "Went to Phish concerts"
- "Collaborated with Madison" → "Worked with Madison"
- "Attended social events" → "Went to [specific place]" or "Hung out with [person]"
- "Visited Gene's" → "Went to Gene's"

### When "Visited" IS Appropriate

- Visiting people (family, friends)
- Visiting meaningful places (graves, memorials)
- Visiting formal places (museums, offices)

### Interpersonal Tasks

- Say "went to" instead of "participated in" or "attended"
- Use specific action verbs: went, met, hung out, grabbed drinks, had dinner
- Avoid "social interactions" - sounds too clinical

### General Tone

- Professional but human - like talking to a competent adult
- NOT corporate buzzword soup
- Use active, specific verbs

## "Do Less" Rules - Keep It Simple

### Strict Week Boundaries

- ONLY summarize tasks from THIS specific week
- NEVER reference previous weeks or future weeks
- NO "continued from last week" or "preparing for next week"
- NO "maintained routine" or "continued pattern"

### No Pattern Recognition or Analysis

- Don't say "worked out consistently" or "maintained routine"
- Don't group similar activities across different days
- Each task is its own thing - don't try to find themes
- Don't assess if it was a "good" or "productive" week
- Don't suggest improvements or notice "gaps"
- Don't comment on frequency or patterns
- Just state what happened, period

### Simple Grouping Only

- Only group obvious duplicates (like "ECG Game 3, 4, 5" → "Played ECG Games 3, 4, 5")
- Don't group different activities just because they're similar
- Don't try to find "themes" or "categories" within the week
- Don't say "multiple social activities" - just list them separately

### Be a Reporter, Not an Analyst

- State what happened, not what it means
- Use simple past tense: "did X, went to Y, worked on Z"
- Be factual and direct

### Examples of What NOT to Do

- ❌ "Maintained consistent workout routine with 3 sessions"
- ✅ "Worked out with Jen, went to gym, did yoga"
- ❌ "Continued social activities with multiple meetups"
- ✅ "Went to Pubkey, had dinner with Madison, met up with Alex"
- ❌ "Focused on health and fitness this week"
- ✅ "Worked out with Jen, went to gym, did yoga"
