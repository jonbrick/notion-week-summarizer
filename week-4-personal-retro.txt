- You were able to reconnect with friends and family, including attending Ravens games, going out for meals, and spending quality time with your partner Jen.
- You completed all of your planned personal tasks, such as planning for the year, updating your journals, and taking care of household chores.

What didn't go so well?
- You did not complete any of the tasks you had planned for the week, which may indicate an imbalance or lack of focus on your professional responsibilities.
- You did not engage in any physical exercise or mental health activities, which could be an area for improvement in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
- Your schedule was heavily skewed towards interpersonal activities, which may have come at the expense of time dedicated to your design engineering work.

Overall?
This week seems to have been focused primarily on your social and personal life, with a lack of attention towards your professional goals and personal well-being. While it's important to maintain a healthy work-life balance, it may be beneficial to reassess your priorities and find ways to better integrate your design engineering work, physical and mental health activities, and interpersonal commitments in the coming weeks.
