## What went well?

This week, Jon made good progress (ðŸ‘¾) on his stated work rock of improving icons and borders. He was able to ship 4 PRs that addressed various aspects of this goal, including:

- ProgressIcon PR
- Badge 2 PR 
- Icons in dark mode PR
- Entity Icon Radius PR

The time allocation also looked strong, with 50% of his time spent on actual coding work, which is right in line with Jon's preferences. He was able to complete a good number of coding tasks and close out several meaningful PRs.

## What didn't go so well?

While the overall output and rock progress were positive, there are a couple areas that could be improved. Jon spent a significant amount of time (44%) in meetings and general administrative tasks, which is a bit on the high side compared to his ideal of under 20% meeting time. Some of these meetings may have been necessary, but it's worth reviewing if there are ways to optimize or streamline the meeting load.

Additionally, Jon didn't complete any research, feedback, or QA tasks this week, which could indicate an imbalance in his workload. It's important to ensure he has time allocated for those important activities as well.

## Overview

In total, Jon worked 34.75 hours this week and completed 9 tasks across design, coding, and administrative work. He shipped 4 PRs with a total of 34 commits. The time breakdown shows 50% on coding, 6% on design, and 44% in meetings/general work. While he made good progress on his main work rock, the high meeting time and lack of time spent on research, feedback, and QA are areas to monitor going forward.
