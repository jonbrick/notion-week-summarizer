# Work Context - Enhanced

I'm Jon, a Design Engineer working on design systems and developer tools.

## Data Structure Definitions

### Calendar Categories

- **Default Work Cal + Rituals Cal**: Meetings and overhead (BAD when high - over 20% of time)
- **Coding & Tickets Cal**: Actual coding work (GOOD)
- **Design Work Cal**: Actual design work (GOOD)
- **Review, Feedback, Crit Cal**: Collaborative work (NEUTRAL/GOOD)
- **Research Cal**: Research work (GOOD)
- **QA Cal**: Quality assurance work (GOOD)

### Work Tasks

- **All categories are neutral**: Research, Design, Coding, Feedback, QA, Admin, Social, OOO
- **Focus on completion**: Any completed work task is positive

### Work Rocks

- **Status meanings**:
  - ✅ Achieved: Excellent - delivered on stated intentions
  - 👾 Made Good Progress: Good - moving in right direction
  - 🚧 Made Little Progress: Concerning - may need to reassess
  - 🥊 Failed: Bad - need to understand what went wrong

### Work Events

- **All work events are generally positive**: Presentations, company meetings, work social events
- **Exception**: 🤒 Sick events explain lower productivity
- **🏝️ Vacation/PTO**: No retrospective needed for these weeks

### PRs (Pull Requests)

- **All PRs are good**: Every shipped PR represents meaningful work
- **List them**: Format like "7 PRs this week - ProgressIcon, Badge 2, Form Labels, etc."

## What Defines a GOOD Work Week

### Rock Progress

- Achieving (✅) or making good progress (👾) on stated work rocks
- Rock intentions align with actual work completed

### Time Quality

- High ratio of actual work (Coding + Design) vs meetings (Default + Rituals)
- Under 20% of time spent in meetings is ideal

### Meaningful Output

- Shipping PRs (all PRs are positive accomplishments)
- Completing work tasks across any category
- Good collaboration with team members

## What Defines a BAD Work Week

### Rock Failure

- Failing (🥊) work rocks or making little progress (🚧)
- Time spent misaligned with stated rock intentions

### Meeting Overhead

- Over 20% of time spent in meetings (Default Work Cal + Rituals Cal)
- Too much administrative overhead vs actual work

### Low Output

- No PRs shipped (unless explained by events like sickness)
- Very few work tasks completed without clear reason

## Context for AI Analysis

### Rock Status Interpretation

- **✅ Achieved**: Excellent - delivered on stated intentions
- **👾 Made Good Progress**: Good - moving in right direction, on track
- **🚧 Made Little Progress**: Concerning - may need to reassess approach
- **🥊 Failed**: Bad - need to understand what went wrong

### Event Context (Milestones)

- **💼 Work events**: Company meetings, presentations, deadlines
- **🍸 Work Social events**: Team events that might affect normal patterns
- **🤒 Sick**: Health issues that explain lower productivity
- **🏝️ Vacation/PTO**: Time off - no retrospective needed for these weeks

### Time vs Completion Analysis

- **High time + low completion**: Could be good (deep work) or bad (inefficiency)
- **Low time + high completion**: Usually good (efficient execution)
- **Time misaligned with rocks**: Concerning if spending time on wrong priorities

## Seasonal Context Considerations

### Busy Periods

- Product launches, major releases
- End of quarter pushes
- Team planning cycles

### Maintenance Periods

- Between major projects
- Holiday seasons with team out
- Post-launch cleanup phases

## Success Metrics Priority

1. **Rock progress** (most important - am I achieving my stated intentions?)
2. **Time quality** (am I spending time on meaningful work?)
3. **Output volume** (how much did I actually ship?)
4. **Team collaboration** (how well did I work with others?)

Remember: A week with fewer completed tasks but strong rock progress and good time allocation is better than a week with lots of busy work but no meaningful progress.
