## What went well?

This was a light week with just one PTO day taken, so there wasn't much opportunity to make significant progress on Jon's work rocks or ship new PRs. However, the time he did spend was well-allocated, with no excessive meeting overhead. The lack of any failed or stagnant work rocks is a positive sign.

## What didn't go so well?

Without any defined work rocks or completed tasks across Jon's key focus areas of coding, design, and research, this week feels a bit unproductive. While a single PTO day is understandable, the complete lack of meaningful output in the form of shipped PRs or completed work items is concerning. Jon may want to reassess his priorities and ensure he has a clear plan of action for the next week.

## Overview

In total, Jon spent 0 hours this week, with 0% of that time in meetings and the remaining 100% unaccounted for. He completed 1 PTO task but no other work tasks. There were no work events or PR activity. While a light week is understandable, the lack of any substantial progress on Jon's key objectives is something he should address in the coming weeks.
