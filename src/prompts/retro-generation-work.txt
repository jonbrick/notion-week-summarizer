{{CONTEXT}}

You are analyzing a work week retrospective. Your job is to READ THE ACTUAL DATA and generate a 4-section retrospective based on what really happened.

## YOUR TASK:
Extract real data from the week summary below and generate exactly 4 sections in this format:

## General?
â€¢ [Neutral facts: total hours, tasks completed, PRs shipped, events attended]

## What went well?
â€¢ [Analyze actual accomplishments and positive patterns]

## What didn't go so well?
â€¢ [Analyze actual problems and missed targets]

## Overview?
"[One sentence assessment: Good week/Rough week/Mixed week - brief reason]"

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH SECTION:

### General?
READ THE DATA and extract all relevant neutral facts:
â€¢ Total calendar hours from different categories
â€¢ Total tasks completed across all categories  
â€¢ Number of PRs shipped and total commits
â€¢ Number of events attended
â€¢ Time ratios (coding vs meetings vs other work)

### What went well?
READ THE DATA and use the CONTEXT to evaluate what was positive:
â€¢ **Accomplished rocks FIRST**: Look at Work Rocks Summary for âœ… or ðŸ‘¾ status. Reference actual rock names and what was achieved
â€¢ **PRs shipped**: List actual PR names/titles from Work PR Summary (all PRs are positive accomplishments)
â€¢ **Good time allocation**: Use CONTEXT to evaluate if time was spent on meaningful work vs meetings
â€¢ **Major work accomplishments**: Summarize substantial task completions across work categories
â€¢ **Events attended**: Reference events from Work Events Summary as positive experiences
â€¢ **Team collaboration**: Highlight successful collaborative work

### What didn't go so well?
READ THE DATA and use the CONTEXT to evaluate what was negative:
â€¢ **Failed rocks FIRST**: Look for ðŸ¥Š or ðŸš§ status in Work Rocks Summary
â€¢ **Poor time allocation**: Use CONTEXT to identify if too much time spent in meetings/overhead
â€¢ **Low output**: Few or no PRs shipped, low task completion without clear reason
â€¢ **Misaligned priorities**: Time spent not matching stated rock intentions

### Overview?
READ THE DATA and use the CONTEXT to give ONE SENTENCE assessment AFTER analyzing everything above:
â€¢ Use the CONTEXT definitions for what makes a good vs bad work week
â€¢ Use EVENTS to explain patterns (e.g., "Good week - strong output despite conference attendance")

## KEY RULES:
â€¢ **USE REAL NUMBERS** - Extract actual counts from the data, don't guess
â€¢ **LIST ACTUAL PRS** - Reference specific PR names/titles from the data
â€¢ **USE EVENTS AS CONTEXT** - Work events explain unusual patterns or priorities
â€¢ **NO FAKE EXAMPLES** - Only reference what actually happened
â€¢ **BE SPECIFIC** - Use actual rock names, actual PR titles, actual time percentages
â€¢ **ANALYZE EVERYTHING FIRST** - Look at every data point and categorize as: neutral fact (General), positive (What went well), or negative (What didn't go well), then make final assessment (Overview)
