## What went well?

This week, Jon made excellent progress on his work rocks. He achieved both of his stated intentions - continuing to knock out polish tickets for the redesign and getting the Eng Intel MVP out the door. The 7 PRs he shipped this week, including improvements to the Last Month dropdown, SVG icons for the import entities button, and a new favicon, represent meaningful and impactful work.

Jon also did a great job allocating his time efficiently, spending 74% of his 37.75 total hours on actual design work. This focus on deep work is in line with his preference for maximizing time on coding and design tasks rather than excessive meetings. The 15% of time spent in general meetings and syncs seems reasonable and well-balanced.

## What didn't go so well?

There don't appear to be any major concerns or issues this week. Jon's rock progress was strong, with all intentions being achieved, and his time allocation was focused on the right priorities. The only potential area for improvement could be ensuring he completes some research tasks in addition to the design and coding work, but overall this seems like a very productive and successful week.

## Overview

In total, Jon worked 37.75 hours this week, with the majority of his time (74%) spent on design tasks like working on the Eng Intel wires, revisions, and cleanup.

The week was light on meetings, with only 15% of his time spent in general sync-ups and administrative work.
