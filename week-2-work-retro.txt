## What went well?

This week was a strong one for Jon. He shipped 3 PRs, including several major updates like the Input Cleanup, Datepicker/Typeahead/Select Height fixes, and improvements to the Avatar and CortexLogo. He also achieved his stated work rock of "Back to work" by really focusing on "front loading" the critical work this month. His time allocation was well-aligned, with 77% of his time spent on actual coding work, which is right in his sweet spot.

## What didn't go so well?

There don't seem to be any major concerns this week. Jon didn't have any failed work rocks, and his meeting time of 23% is within the ideal 20% range. The only potential hiccup was that he didn't complete any design or research tasks, but given his focus on shipping those big coding PRs, that's understandable.

## General?

This was a fairly typical work week for Jon. No major company events or social activities occurred that would have disrupted his normal workflow. The weather and other external factors don't appear to have played a significant role. It was simply a solid, heads-down week of knocking out important engineering work.

## Overall?

Good week - Jon achieved his main work rock, shipped several meaningful PRs, and maintained a healthy work-life balance with his time allocation.
