# Work Context - Enhanced

I'm Jon, a Design Engineer working on design systems and developer tools.

## BULLET FORMAT EXAMPLES

### Good "What went well" bullets:

â€¢ Achieved rock - Back to work (front loading Jan work)
â€¢ 3 PRs shipped - Input Cleanup, Datepicker/Typeahead fixes, Avatar & CortexLogo
â€¢ 77% coding time, 23% meetings - excellent ratio
â€¢ Eng Intel kickoff with Madison and Zac's help
â€¢ Nice review from Zac on 66 days work

### Good "What didn't go well" bullets:

â€¢ Failed rock - API Documentation (ðŸ¥Š)
â€¢ 31% meeting time - too much overhead
â€¢ No PRs shipped this week
â€¢ Time misaligned - spent on admin vs stated coding priorities

## Data Structure Definitions

### Calendar Categories

- **Default Work Cal + Rituals Cal**: Meetings and overhead (BAD when high - over 20% of time)
- **Coding & Tickets Cal**: Actual coding work (GOOD)
- **Design Work Cal**: Actual design work (GOOD)
- **Review, Feedback, Crit Cal**: Collaborative work (NEUTRAL/GOOD)
- **Research Cal**: Research work (GOOD)
- **QA Cal**: Quality assurance work (GOOD)

### Work Rocks

- **Status meanings**:
  - âœ… Achieved: Excellent - delivered on stated intentions
  - ðŸ‘¾ Made Good Progress: Good - moving in right direction
  - ðŸš§ Made Little Progress: Concerning - may need to reassess
  - ðŸ¥Š Failed: Bad - need to understand what went wrong

### PRs (Pull Requests)

- **All PRs are good**: Every shipped PR represents meaningful work
- **Format**: "7 PRs: ProgressIcon, Badge 2, Form Labels, Brand Icons, etc."

## What Defines a GOOD Work Week

### Rock Progress

- Achieving (âœ…) or making good progress (ðŸ‘¾) on stated work rocks
- Rock intentions align with actual work completed

### Time Quality

- High ratio of actual work (Coding + Design) vs meetings (Default + Rituals)
- Under 20% of time spent in meetings is ideal

### Meaningful Output

- Shipping PRs (all PRs are positive accomplishments)
- Completing work tasks across any category
- Good collaboration with team members

## What Defines a BAD Work Week

### Rock Failure

- Failing (ðŸ¥Š) work rocks or making little progress (ðŸš§)
- Time spent misaligned with stated rock intentions

### Meeting Overhead

- Over 20% of time spent in meetings (Default Work Cal + Rituals Cal)
- Too much administrative overhead vs actual work

### Low Output

- No PRs shipped (unless explained by events like sickness)
- Very few work tasks completed without clear reason

## Success Metrics Priority

1. **Rock progress** (most important - am I achieving my stated intentions?)
2. **Time quality** (am I spending time on meaningful work?)
3. **Output volume** (how much did I actually ship?)
4. **Team collaboration** (how well did I work with others?)

Remember: A week with fewer completed tasks but strong rock progress and good time allocation is better than a week with lots of busy work but no meaningful progress.
