{{CONTEXT}}

You are analyzing a personal week retrospective. Your job is to READ THE ACTUAL DATA and generate a 4-section retrospective based on what really happened.

## YOUR TASK:
Extract real data from the week summary below and generate exactly 4 sections in this format:

## General?
â€¢ [Neutral facts: total hours, tasks completed, events attended]

## What went well?
â€¢ [Analyze actual accomplishments and positive patterns]

## What didn't go so well?
â€¢ [Analyze actual problems and missed targets]

## Overview?
"[One sentence assessment: Good week/Rough week/Mixed week - brief reason]"

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH SECTION:

### General?
READ THE DATA and extract all relevant neutral facts:
â€¢ Total calendar hours from different categories
â€¢ Total tasks completed across all categories  
â€¢ Number of events attended
â€¢ Other concrete metrics (PRs, commits, etc.)

### What went well?
READ THE DATA and use the CONTEXT to evaluate what was positive:
â€¢ **Accomplished rocks FIRST**: Look at Personal Rocks Summary for âœ… or ðŸ‘¾ status. Reference actual rock names and what was achieved
â€¢ **Health habits SECOND**: Extract actual numbers from habit data and use CONTEXT to determine if targets were met
â€¢ **Major accomplishments**: Summarize substantial task completions (if many home tasks, summarize what was built/organized; if many interpersonal tasks, summarize social activities)
â€¢ **Events attended**: Reference events from Personal Events Summary as positive experiences
â€¢ **Time well spent**: If significant calendar time in meaningful activities, mention it

### What didn't go so well?
READ THE DATA and use the CONTEXT to evaluate what was negative:
â€¢ **Failed rocks FIRST**: Look for ðŸ¥Š or ðŸš§ status in Personal Rocks Summary
â€¢ **Missed health targets SECOND**: Use CONTEXT to determine if health targets were missed
â€¢ **Low accomplishment areas**: Categories with very few or no completed tasks

### Overview?
READ THE DATA and use the CONTEXT to give ONE SENTENCE assessment AFTER analyzing everything above:
â€¢ Use the CONTEXT definitions for what makes a good vs bad personal week
â€¢ Use EVENTS to explain patterns (e.g., "Good week - productive despite 52-hour Phish celebration")

## KEY RULES:
â€¢ **USE REAL NUMBERS** - Extract actual counts from the data, don't guess
â€¢ **SUMMARIZE ACCOMPLISHMENTS** - If someone completed 14 home tasks, say what they built/organized
â€¢ **USE EVENTS AS CONTEXT** - Large events explain unusual patterns
â€¢ **NO FAKE EXAMPLES** - Only reference what actually happened
â€¢ **BE SPECIFIC** - Use actual rock names, actual task summaries, actual numbers
â€¢ **ANALYZE EVERYTHING FIRST** - Look at every data point and categorize as: neutral fact (General), positive (What went well), or negative (What didn't go well), then make final assessment (Overview)
