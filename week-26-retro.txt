Retrospective for Week 26:

What went well?

- Delivered high-quality design work, including 3 design tasks focused on improving the dashboard building experience.
- Made steady progress on coding tasks, with 2 PRs merged that improved the UI and developer experience.
- Maintained good work-life balance, with no reported overtime or weekend work.

What didn't go so well?

- The design work was quite intensive, taking up 58% of my time, which could lead to potential burnout if this continues.
- There was a high meeting load, with 11 meetings/rituals taking up 25% of my time, which could impact focus and productivity.
- Didn't complete any feedback tasks this week, which is an area for improvement.

Overall?

Overall, it was a productive week with a good balance of design and engineering work. However, the high design workload and meeting load are areas that need to be monitored and addressed to ensure sustainable productivity and work-life balance in the long run.
