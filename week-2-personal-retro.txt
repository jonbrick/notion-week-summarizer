Here is a retrospective with three sections based on the provided personal data:

What Went Well?
- Maintained a good work-life balance, with the majority of time spent on interpersonal activities rather than work.
- Proactively planned and recapped several weeks' worth of tasks, showing strong organizational skills.
- Completed a morning workout, demonstrating a commitment to physical health.

What Didn't Go So Well?
- No tasks were completed during the week, indicating a potential lack of productivity or focus.
- No time was spent on development or hobbies, suggesting an imbalance in work-life integration.
- Several "drunk text" and late-night activities may indicate a need to reflect on healthy boundaries and self-care.

Overall?
The week seemed to be heavily focused on social and interpersonal activities, with little time dedicated to professional development or personal hobbies. While maintaining a good work-life balance is important, the lack of progress on tasks and the potential for unhealthy behaviors suggest there may be room for improvement in terms of finding a more sustainable and balanced routine.
